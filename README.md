- Incident investigation
	- system outages, security breaches, or performance bottlenecks.
- How do you ensure high availability and reliability of systems you manage?
	- "In my previous role, I ensured high availability by implementing a multi-tiered approach that included load balancers to distribute traffic evenly, redundant systems to handle failover seamlessly, and real-time monitoring to detect and resolve issues promptly. We adhered to the ITIL framework for service management, which helped us achieve an uptime of 99.99% over the past year."
- Describe your experience with automation of operational tasks. 
- How do you handle incident management and resolution?
	- In the event of an incident, my first step is to assess the impact and prioritize the issue based on severity. I then communicate the status to stakeholders using an incident management tool like PagerDuty. For resolution, I follow a structured approach to diagnose the problem, apply a fix, and conduct a post-mortem analysis to prevent future occurrences.
- What metrics do you monitor to assess system performance, and why?
	- What metrics do you monitor to assess system performance, and why?I monitor a range of metrics, including CPU and memory usage, disk I/O, network latency, and error rates.

For example, by keeping an eye on memory consumption, I can proactively scale resources or troubleshoot memory leaks before they affect users.
- Can you discuss a time when you had to troubleshoot a complex system issue?
	- Once, I encountered a sporadic database performance issue that was difficult to replicate. I set up detailed logging and monitored the system to capture the problem in real-time.

Regular audits and vulnerability assessments are part of our routine to identify and mitigate risks promptly.
- How do you ensure effective communication and collaboration with other teams?
	- To ensure effective communication, I use collaboration platforms like Slack for day-to-day communication and Jira for tracking tasks and projects. I also hold regular cross-departmental meetings to align on goals and initiatives. This approach has fostered a collaborative environment and has led to more integrated and efficient project workflows.
